# keylogger
A program that saves the keystrokes to a txt file and send to your Outlook account.
It works as headless.
Once the shortcut is in the Startup folder, Windows will automatically run the script every time the user logs in. You won't need to enter any command; it will start as soon as Windows boots up and the user logs in.
If you want to stop running the code just go to the Task Manager and find the python in background processes then end the task.
